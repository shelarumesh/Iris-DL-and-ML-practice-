# Iris-DL-and-ML-practice-
Practice for ANN deep learning and logistic Machine Learning 

# Problem Understanding:

Define the problem: Classify iris flowers into three species based on certain features.
Understand the business or research objectives: Achieve accurate classification for research purposes or to develop a predictive model for future flower classification.
Determine the success criteria: Achieve a high accuracy rate in classifying iris flowers.
Assess the situation: Understand the available resources, data, and constraints.

# Data Understanding:

Gather initial data: Obtain the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers.
Describe data: Examine basic statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, min/max values, and data distributions.
Explore data: Visualize the data using histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to identify patterns and relationships between features.
Verify data quality: Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.

# Data Preprocessing:

Clean data: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies by imputation, removal, or transformation techniques.
Select data: Choose relevant features that contribute to the classification task.
Transform data: Normalize or standardize features to ensure that they have a similar scale and distribution.
Engineer features: Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the model's performance.
Split data: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance properly.

# Modeling:

Select modeling techniques: Choose appropriate machine learning or deep learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks.
Build models: Implement logistic regression and simple artificial neural network (ANN) models using libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow/Keras.
Train models: Fit the models to the training data and tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Validate models: Evaluate model performance using the validation set to ensure generalizability and prevent overfitting.
Assess models: Measure the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics to assess model performance.

# Evaluation:

Evaluate results: Compare the performance of logistic regression and simple ANN models based on accuracy and other metrics.
Review process: Reflect on the methodology used, potential shortcomings, and areas for improvement.
Determine next steps: Decide whether to refine existing models, explore alternative algorithms, or gather additional data to improve performance.
